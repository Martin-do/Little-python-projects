# Little-python-projects
Basic python projects for real beginners, working with lists, loops, etc
This is a code aimed at calculating the grade point of students. 
It's the grading system used in most Universities (I'm sure of Nigeria) 
The "unit_x_mark" function can be changed cos the range of values varies in different universities 
with varying points too
Hope to add some code to be able to export all user data into a csv file
